Welcome to my something like a blog. It as a pretty old idea to create a blog but I didn't want to mess with the CMS like WordPress and others, for this kind of blog I prefer simplicity and the rich features of markdown.

## ðŸ“š What this blog will be about?

To be honest, I don't know how far I will go with this, for me this is more like an experiment, if the people will be interested in the stuff that I'm interested at, then of course I'll continue to post things there. I will try to make this blog on Github look simple as possible even for people that are not familiar with Github, because this platform is mostly focused on developers for storing code and stuff.
