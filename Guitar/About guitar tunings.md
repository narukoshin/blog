# Guitar tunings... What the?

If you're playing guitar, you should at least know what guitar tuning means. If, for some reason, you don't know that, well, you're doing something wrong. So, what the heck is guitar tuning, you ask? Guitar tuning is adjusting the pitch of the strings to specific notes.

The most commonly used guitar tuning, and also the default tuning, is E standard. If you buy a new guitar from a shop, it will probably already be in E standard tuning.

## How many tunings are there?

Umm, that's a tricky question because there are thousands of different tunings available. But if you want to know how many tunings are mathematically possible, we need to do a little math.

For example, if you have a 6-string guitar, you can set a different note for each string. There are a total of 12 notes that you can use to tune each string.

We can use a formula of permutation: $P^n_r = \frac{n!}{n-r}$ <br />
...or simply using $n^r$


The formula for this is 12 (notes available) ^ 6 (strings total) = 2,985,984 possible tunings. That means you have around 3 million tunings available for a 6-string guitar. What about a 7-string guitar? Using the same formula and doing a bit of black magic, you get 35 million tunings.

Most tunings have specific names. For example, there's E standard, but also B standard, Db standard, etc. There are also Drop and Open tunings. One of the most popular drop tunings is Drop D. If your guitar is in E standard, you only need to lower the 6th string to D, and voila, you have Drop D tuning. Easy, right?

Drop C,  So, do I just lower my 6th string to C?
Well, not exactly. That would be E Drop C.
Wait, what?
Yep! If you're a beginner guitarist, this can be confusing, but that's how it works. You just need to remember the names. When you see a tuning like C Drop D, you know it's C standard tuning with the 6th string dropped to D.
Why should I even change my guitar tuning?
Changing your guitar tuning opens up a wide range of musical possibilities and offers several benefits, depending on the style or sound you're aiming for.


Lower tunings (like Drop C, Drop D, or D standard) give you a heavier, deeper sound often used in genres like metal and hard rock. They create a fuller, more powerful tone. Drop tunings make power chords easier to play. In Drop D, for example, you can play power chords with just one finger across the lowest three strings, making riffing fast and simple.

Open tunings (like Open G or Open D) create a richer harmonic resonance that suits folk, blues, and slide guitar playing, giving a natural drone or chordal sound without complex fingerings.
