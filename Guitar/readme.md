# <b>Topic › 🎸 Guitar</b>

Welcome to the world of guitars! In this topic, I'll be sharing everything I know about guitars—some theory, some practical insights, and more.

If you don’t know who I am, let me introduce myself quickly. I’m ENKO, and I’ve been playing guitar for around a year. You might think that's not a lot of time, but I don’t like sitting in one place. I’m always trying to learn something new. Right now, the guitar is the instrument I use the most.. 

At the moment, I own just one guitar ー an Ibanez GSA60 (which I bought earlier this year 😋). With this guitar, I’ve already learned a lot, and I’ve even adjusted it myself. In terms of genres, I mainly play rock and metal, but as a producer, I mostly create Japanese vocaloid music, hyperpop, and something in that direction. I also use the guitar to make different FX sounds. If you ever have free time to play around with different tones and amp settings, you can come up with some very interesting sounds, some even by accident, like how I created some of my FX. I enjoy experimenting, and I hope you will too!
