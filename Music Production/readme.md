# <b>Topic â€º ðŸŽ¹ Music Production</b>

Welcome to the music production topic. There I'll write everything about the music production, tutorials, maybe tricks&tips, etc. 

How I began making music? Actually this is kind of difficult story, because I didn't wake up with the mind - I will start to make music.

I donâ€™t clearly remember my first experience with music; it could have been when I started serving as the sound operator at school events or when I began making nightcore and speedcore covers of songs. In primary school, I had the opportunity to learn how to work with a mixer and speakers. I was the only one in the school who knew what every button on the mixer did. I remember once asking what "Phantom Power" meant, and the man teaching me, who didnâ€™t have a music background, didnâ€™t know. Later, I figured out that "Phantom Power" is the 48V output used for condenser microphones.

After some time, I decided I wanted to become a DJ. I bought my first DJ controller, the DDJ SB-2, which I still have, though I donâ€™t use it anymore, so itâ€™s just collecting dust. I think I was a DJ for only 2-3 years before realizing I wanted to be a DJ producer â€” that makes remixes and things like that. However, I didn't actually started creating remixes. I set my mind on making my own music instead of just remixing existing songs.

When you first get into music, you donâ€™t know much, like which DAW to use or what plugins you need. Initially, I was thinking about starting with Cubase, but it was quite difficult to, khm, cr#ck and get it to work properly. So, I ended up using a cr#cked version of Ableton, and I fell in love with it. (By the way, Iâ€™m now using a legal version of Ableton, so no worries!)
