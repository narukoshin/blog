# <b>Topic › 🎹 Music Production</b>

Welcome to the music production topic. There I'll write everything about the music production, tutorials, maybe tricks&tips, etc. 

How I began making music? Actually this is kind of difficult story, because I didn't wake up with the mind - I will start to make music.

I don’t clearly remember my first experience with music; it could have been when I started serving as the sound operator at school events or when I began making nightcore and speedcore covers of songs. In primary school, I had the opportunity to learn how to work with a mixer and speakers. I was the only one in the school who knew what every button on the mixer did. I remember once asking what "Phantom Power" meant, and the man teaching me, who didn’t have a music background, didn’t know. Later, I figured out that "Phantom Power" is the 48V output used for condenser microphones.

After some time, I decided I wanted to become a DJ. I bought my first DJ controller, the DDJ SB-2, which I still have, though I don’t use it anymore, so it’s just collecting dust. I think I was a DJ for only 2-3 years before realizing I wanted to be a DJ producer — that makes remixes and things like that. However, I didn't actually started creating remixes. I set my mind on making my own music instead of just remixing existing songs.

When you first get into music, you don’t know much, like which DAW to use or what plugins you need. Initially, I was thinking about starting with Cubase, but it was quite difficult to, khm, cr#ck and get it to work properly. So, I ended up using a cr#cked version of Ableton, and I fell in love with it. (By the way, I’m now using a legal version of Ableton, so no worries!)
