Welcome, there! This topic isn’t just about programming — it’ll also cover security testing and other tech-related topics.

I’ve been into programming since childhood. Now that I’m 23, I realize I started programming when I was around 13-ish, which feels like quite a while ago. I’ve experimented with many programming languages over the years; one of my first was PHP, but now I mainly work with Go and Python. If you’re reading this, you’re probably interested in programming too. In that case, feel free to check out my GitHub profile, where I’ve published many of the projects I’ve worked on.
